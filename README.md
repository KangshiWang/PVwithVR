This is a Unity 3D project file designed for visualizing photovoltaic systems and simulating their shading patterns. For comprehensive information, refer to my paper, "A Virtual Reality based Shading Pattern Recognition and Interactive Global Maximum Power Point Tracking in Photovoltaic Systems." Given that the paper is yet to be published, I invite you to reach out to me at kangshi_wang@outlook.com for further specifics. The project's introductory materials and detailed descriptions are presently under development.
